This is my understanding after reading [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) and
[Gabriella Gonzalez](https://www.haskellforall.com/2021/09/forward-and-reverse-proxies-explained.html).
### Proxy
Meant to make a request on a client's behalf aka to be a middle man in an online request.
### Reverse Proxy
A proxy that allows the proxy to select the destination server. This is meant to protect the identity of the server which served the request.
### Forwared Proxy
A proxy that allows the client to select the destination server. This is meant to protect the identity of the client which is requesting.
### Transparent Proxy
This proxy intercepts all internet traffic from a source. Can be used within organization to provide for a common internet security policy.
