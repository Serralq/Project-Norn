# From a student's POV, about the Job Market
After high school graduation, I landed a job by automating so much during my
internship at the project management office which resulted in a full time tech
position. It was more that I had stumbled into this job, but now I keep hearing
news about strong applicants taking hundreds of tries to find their job.

The issue isn't the lack of information, but trying to sort how relevant this
inforamtion is to my particular job market. In my close circle of friends,
everyone found a position after 2 months of trying, even those with only basic
understanding of concepts like TCP or SSH, so which determining which way the
wind is blowing is like trying to figure out the chances of alien life, it's
really simple to be a wrong by a magnitude in either direction.

## Value of CS Degree
But, I was able to talk a mechanical engineer PhD student, and he gave me parts of
his perspective. This is my understanding of what he shared.

My first doubt was that he could learn to do my job, but I can't learn to do his
job, so what did my degree give me? It was as if computer science was the just
the engineering department's of a business major. Rather any engineering degree
is meant to build human capital. Most engineering degree required large budgets
to begin practicing, so the initial steps are funded by the college and then
with this basic version of a specialization the company would continue to nurture
by providing problem sets for a graduate to level up to a senior engineer. Computer
science still required a culmination of human capital but this process is
significantly cheaper, but this still requires time and effort to complete.
Beyond the minimum required budget, college still provides the CS student with
professors and a set curiculumn that gives guidance to avoid all the worst
pitfalls.

## Etc.
So a CS degree is not the same as a business degree, but my working theory to
explain my confusion is that the CS student body has a business major mindset.

This was written less to assert any facts and more to allow me to selfishly pad
out my article count and to organize my thoughts.
