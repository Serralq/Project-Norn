The time I spend here is time I could've spent making money.  However, my current largest time sink is learning and this blog is meant as a public rubber duck to augment the time I do spend studying.</p> <p>A blog should be a proxy for practice.

This means to simply write according to a general subject matter.  My current best practice is to type without looking at the screen.  This gives time to think but removes the ability for perfectionist tendencies.</p> <p>This vomit should yield a sufficient purpose to the article from which all following sessions should aim towards. The value of an article is not about the subject of an article but what the article can bring to the reader, so that's what should be written for.</p> <p>Finally, it's time to edit in place.  First break down what I've written into proof, reasoning, and conclusions and ensure that each step follows through logically. Also, make sure that the limitations of each conclusion is addressed and add examples whenever possible. These two traits are generic to any kind of reasoned conclusions. Moreover, forming an example requires checking the example, so it can become a personal practice question.</p> <p>There's optionally adding counter argumentation if I need to convince myself.  Counter argumentation is an indirect line of reasoning and therefore by default is ignored. In my personal mental model for deciding tasks, non-direct paths must justify their own existence since in general direct paths get more stuff done per unit of time.</p> <p>Next is the cutting phase. In this phase, use questions over a set standard. Standards by themselves can have ranges of values but questions have a set comparison point that leads to clearer decisions.  A few effective questions are:</p> <ul> <li>\"Why can't another article replace my blog post?\"</li> <li>\"Are there any sections I would skip?\"</li> <li>\"What cadence is there reading the article?\"</li> </ul> <p>Finally, one grammer and spelling check and I'm now forced to publish.</p>"},{"location":"about/about.html#software","title":"Software","text":"<p>Use emacs (with olivetti-mode plugin).

Many online articles will talk about using this as a note taking system, and you do take notes into this system, but you don't want to actually try to retrieve what's already in this system.

Zettelkasten is generally perceived as a set of nodes linked together. These nodes are also connected with edges that themselves serve as informational containers. If every note was like this, then finding the one singular answer would take the original amount of time that a collapsed singular subject note would take and extra time to traverse the Zettelkasten web. However, the same timeline can and will be one line of thought within the Zettelkasten system.   Why encode this entire timeline? Well, the timeline not only has the set of changes but it can hold the reason for the changes, and if the reason was decent enough to create another information node, then the same reasoning could possibly lead to more nodes in another context. And this is exactly what an argument is founded upon.   Another way to think of this, is that you don't go to a discussion class just to read the textbook, but to talk with others to find information beyond the textbook. From this way of seeing things, the Zettelkasten, wouldn't just be the regular study notes with additional information about changes, but it should exclude the regular study note information and only include information of changes. The changes may be changes to what you had originally assumed or what your note system had assumed, either is fine.</p>"},{"location":"about/zettlr.html#limitations","title":"Limitations","text":"<p>This type of system can only work for when arguments are possible, when there is no singular correct answer, as in research or thesis writing, but without this, then the effort is not worth the payoff.

This value is only worth it with a direction and while there can be marginal benefits from using Zettelkasten on a small scale, the same effort could've been used on a regular notes system for greater effects.   This is not to say that parts of the Zettelkasten method cannot be utilized in a regular note system. For example, the fleeting note is useful to collect the full picture before writing, but the Zettelkasten method cannot be the basis of a regular notes system. That would be like using a hammer to build a pc.

There's also a variety of accessories to attach to the music box. Another customization option is to get a image printed onto the wooden boxes, this is not availible for the plastic boxes. However, this would require some time for the store to complete and will be shipped to you are a period of time.
