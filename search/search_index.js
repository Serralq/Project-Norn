However, the same timeline can and will be one line of thought within the Zettelkasten system.   Why encode this entire timeline? Well, the timeline not only has the set of changes but it can hold the reason for the changes, and if the reason was decent enough to create another information node, then the same reasoning could possibly lead to more nodes in another context. And this is exactly what an argument is founded upon.   Another way to think of this, is that you don't go to a discussion class just to read the textbook, but to talk with others to find information beyond the textbook. From this way of seeing things, the Zettelkasten, wouldn't just be the regular study notes with additional information about changes, but it should exclude the regular study note information and only include information of changes.

This value is only worth it with a direction and while there can be marginal benefits from using Zettelkasten on a small scale, the same effort could've been used on a regular notes system for greater effects.   This is not to say that parts of the Zettelkasten method cannot be utilized in a regular note system. For example, the fleeting note is useful to collect the full picture before writing, but the Zettelkasten method cannot be the basis of a regular notes system.
